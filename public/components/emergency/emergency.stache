  <h4 class="alert-heading">LBH3 runs are postponed until further notice</h4>
  <p>In accordance with <a class="alert-link" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/">California’s “stay at home” order</a>, LBH3 has postponed all of our runs. We will not be laying any “virtual” trails.</p>
  <p>Once the order has been lifted and it is safe to gather in large groups, we will begin hosting runs again.</p>
  <p class="mb-0">Please stay safe and healthy so we can all hash together again soon. On on.</p>
