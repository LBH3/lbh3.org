      <h4 class="alert-heading">LBH3 runs have tentatively restarted every Sunday at 10 AM</h4>
      <p>Here’s how trails will work until further notice:</p>
      <ul class="mb-3 pl-4">
        <li>Trails are pre-laid before 10 AM. Please run “virtual” trail any time after then.</li>
        <li>Beer is available on trail on a first come, first served basis. No beer, munchies, or circle after trail.</li>
        <li>

        <li>You will receive LBH3 run credit toward patches only if you pay Hash Cash (or email for punch cards).</li>
        <li>We don’t encourage groups on trail. Wear a mask. Don’t be an asshole.</li>

    <p>We have postponed all of our runs in accordance with <a class="alert-link" href="https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/">California’s “stay at home” order</a>. We will not be laying any “virtual” trails.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">Once it is safe to gather in large groups, we will begin hosting runs again. Please stay safe and healthy so we can all hash together again soon. On on.</p>
