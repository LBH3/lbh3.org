<h2>LBH3 Erection ðŸ—³</h2>

<p class="lead">
  Vote in our <del>election</del> erection for the 2019 Mismanagement.
</p>

<p>
  For the first time ever, weâ€™re taking our erection and putting it online! The
  online ballot is the same as the ballot you can receive in person. Youâ€™re
  still required to have at least six runs in the last year to vote.
</p>

<p><em><strong>
  If you already took a paper ballot, you are not eligible to vote online.
</strong></em></p>
