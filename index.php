          The Long Beach kennel was founded over 30 years ago.
          We run Thursday evening during Spring/Summer &amp; Sunday morning in the Fall/Winter.
          We often have an attendance of 75+.
          Visitors &amp; Virgins are always welcome!
          Your run donation covers Hare essentials, pre– and post–run beer/soda/munchies.
          Please bring a vessel for your beverage.
          We hope to see you at LBH3.
          On On!!!

						Okay, so MRA signed up to hare the last Sunday run, but as a condition of his being on hare probation, all 3 trailmasters (Victoria Secretions, KooKoo and Hokey Tokey) will be escorting him on this trail to guide him around any poison oak.  So while the trail might not be Run of the Year like Victoria and KooKoo's was last year, at least you won't be needing any Tecnu!  Small dog friendly, not stroller friendly.  There are several people who can only do Sunday runs, so after this hash, we start Thursday runs and you won't see them again until October, so come out and say goodbye!
